# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
It's clear by problem constraints that we have to solve this prolem in either O(N) or O(NlogN).

In this problem we have to find `minimum maximum difference` among all p pairs. To get this difference minimum we have to form pairs from closer elements. So to get that we can `sort` the array in descending or ascending order.

Now, if you understood this, you just have to observe there is a pattern here. If current difference `diff` is achievable from the array than all the differences greater than `diff` are achievable. Now did you remember something from above statement. :)

Yes, this problem can be solved by using `binary search`. Here low is `0` and high can be `nums[n-1] - nums[0]`. Now we run binary search on `range [low, high]` and for each mid be checkout whether it is possible to make p pairs from array and then divide the range in half.

# Code
```
class Solution {
    public int minimizeMax(int[] nums, int p) {
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        int n = nums.length;

        //range 0-> max diff
        int low =0, high = nums[n-1] - nums[0];

        while(low < high){
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;

            //get number of maximum pairs we can get
            int maxPairs= 0;
            for(int i=1; i<n; i++){
                if(nums[i] - nums[i-1] <= mid){
                    maxPairs++;
                    i++;
                }
            }

            if(maxPairs >= p){
                high = mid;
            }
            else{
                low = mid + 1;
            }
        }

        return low;
    }
