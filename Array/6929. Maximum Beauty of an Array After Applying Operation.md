# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->

In this problem, we have to find longest subsequence consisting of equal elements after appyling given operations any number of times once per index. 

Now this is basically [lower bound, upper bound] question. So simply our first step would be to `sort the array` because we need to find the longest subsequence (not subarray so index doesn't matter). 

now we will simply run a `sliding window` to find maximum beauty of the array. 

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
Here at each index j or (right endpoint) we will eliminate elements from left hand side of the window and we will keep track of the answer as `ans = max(ans, j-i+1)`.

To eliminate elements from left hand side of the window we will check this condition `nums[i] + k < nums[j] - k`. While it is true we will do i++.  

Here lowest number we can achieve from current index is nums[j] - k. And the highest number we can get from i (start of window) is nums[i] + k. So if `nums[i] + k >= nums[j] - k` then only we can have ith element in our subsequence. So we will degrade the size of window according to that condition.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(nlogn)
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

- Space complexity: O(1)
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

# Code
```
class Solution {
    public int maximumBeauty(int[] nums, int k) {
        
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        // sort(nums.begin(), nums.end()); for c++
        
        int max = 1, i=0;
        
        for(int j=0; j<nums.length; j++) {
            
            while(nums[i] + k < nums[j] - k) {
                i++;
            }
            
            max = Math.max(max, j - i + 1);
        }
        
        return max;
    }
}
```
