# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
Problem link : [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/permutations/)

Here we have to visit/take all the elements at last (order does not matter). So can we maintain visited array in our recursion call? ..Yes, we can. Now at each recursive call we have to choose one element randomly that is not visited to make permutation.

To choose element randomly we choose all unvisited elements one by one and make recursive call to take next number. 

Check solution for better understanding.

class Solution {

    List<List<Integer>> ans = new ArrayList<>();

    public List<List<Integer>> permute(int[] nums) {
        //call function
        solve(nums, new ArrayList<>(), new boolean [nums.length]);
        return ans;    
    }

    void solve(int [] nums, List<Integer> arr, boolean [] visited) {

        //if all elements are visited then add permutation to answer
        if(arr.size() == nums.length) {

            // to make duplicate of list (to prevent changes in list)
            List<Integer> tmp = new ArrayList<>(arr);
            ans.add(tmp);
            return;
        }

        //take all unvisited elements one by one as a current element
        for(int i=0; i<nums.length; i++) {
            if(!visited[i]) {

                //mark this as visited and add it to our list
                visited[i] = true;
                arr.add(nums[i]);

                solve(nums, arr, visited);

                //mark this unvisited and remove it from list as well
                arr.remove(arr.size() - 1);
                visited[i] = false;
            }
        }
