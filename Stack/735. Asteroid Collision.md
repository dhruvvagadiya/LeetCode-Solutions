# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
Problem link : [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/asteroid-collision/)

Observations : 
    1. Positive asteroids (right-moving) may interact with negative asteroids (left-moving) that come later.
    2. Negative astroid (left moving) may interact with astroids on the left (right moving). So for this they will never interact with upcoming astroids.

For this solution we can use stack to store remaining astroids and iterate through the array to find out resulting astroids.

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
While iterating we will check this conditions : 

1. If the stack is `empty` then we can push that astroid as it will not collide with anyone.
2. If `arr[i] > 0` that means it is moving towards right so what is stored in the stack (prev remaining astroids) will not matter. So we can push this astroid directly.
3. If `arr[i] < 0 && st.peek() < 0` -> that means current astroid and prev both are moving in same directions.
4. Now, in remaining one case astroids will collide. Here we will keep removing astroids until there is no collision/astroids are destroyed.

# Code
```
class Solution {
    public int[] asteroidCollision(int[] arr) {
        Stack<Integer> st = new Stack<>();

        for(int i=0; i<arr.length; i++){

            //first 3 conditions
            if(st.isEmpty() || arr[i] > 0 || st.peek() < 0) st.push(arr[i]);
            //can use while loop also
            else if(st.peek() <= -arr[i]){
                if(st.peek() < -arr[i]){
                    i--;
                }
                st.pop();
            }
        }

        int [] ans = new int [st.size()];
        for(int i=st.size() - 1; i >= 0; i--){
            ans[i] = st.pop();
        }

        return ans;
    }
}
