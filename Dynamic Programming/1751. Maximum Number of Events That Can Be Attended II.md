<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
Problem link : [1751. Maximum Number of Events That Can Be Attended II](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-events-that-can-be-attended-ii/)

In this type of problem first we will sort the array by ascending order of stating time.

Now, this is a classic `knapsack problem`, in which we can either choose to `attend the event` or we can `skip it` and move to the next index. 

So it is clear that we will have two states for our problem. (ind, k).

Now if you look at problem constraints we can not solve it using recursion. So we will have to memoize it in order to pass the testcases. 

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
In this problem we will start our code from state (0, k). And at each stage we will do two things.

`notAttend = solve(ind + 1, k)`
`attend = solve(nextIndex, k-1)`

here next index is the index where starting time of index is greater than ending time of current event we can find it using binary search or simple loop. and we will return maximum of both as a answer.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n * k)
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

- Space complexity: O(n * k)
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

# Recursion solution
```
class Solution {
    public int maxValue(int[][] events, int k) {

        //sort by starting time of event
        Arrays.sort(events, (a,b)-> a[0] - b[0]);

        return solver(0, k, events);
    }

    int solver(int ind, int left, int [][] arr) {

        if(ind >= arr.length || left == 0) return 0;

        //finding next index
        int i;
        for(i=ind; i<arr.length; i++){
            if(arr[i][0] > arr[ind][1]){
                break;
            }
        }

        int take = arr[ind][2] + solver(i, left-1, arr);
        //not take
        int not = solver(ind + 1, left, arr);

        return Math.max(take, not);
    }
}
```

# Dynamic Programming solution
```
class Solution {
    public int maxValue(int[][] events, int k) {

        Arrays.sort(events, (a,b)-> a[0] - b[0]);

        //Dp to store values
        int [][] dp = new int [events.length][k+1];
        for(int [] ar : dp){
            Arrays.fill(ar, -1);
        }

        return solver(0, k, events, dp);
    }

    int solver(int ind, int left, int [][] arr, int [][] dp) {

        if(ind >= arr.length || left == 0) return 0;

        //check if the states are previously visited
        if(dp[ind][left] != -1) {
            return dp[ind][left];
        }

        //finding next index
        int i;
        for(i=ind; i<arr.length; i++){
            if(arr[i][0] > arr[ind][1]){
                break;
            }
        }

        int take = arr[ind][2] + solver(i, left-1, arr, dp);
        //not take
        int not = solver(ind + 1, left, arr, dp);

        return dp[ind][left] = Math.max(take, not);
    }
