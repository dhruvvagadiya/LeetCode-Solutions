# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
In this problem we have to find `Longest Arithmetic Subsequence of Given Difference k`.

This problem can be solved using `dynamic programming or hashmap`. let's understand how.

Suppose you are at any index i. now for each index we want to find longest Arithmetic Subsequence that contains nums[i] as last element. As this is A.P. previous element will be `nums[i] - k`. So our `answer for current index = 1 + ans(nums[i] - k).` 

So by this we can form a dp with relation dp[i] = dp[i-k] + 1. (suppose i is the element)

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
Here simply we will maintain a hashmap which will store answer for current array elements. Now for each index we will save answer as
`ans[curr] = ans[curr - k] + 1;` And we will keep track of max as a answer.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(N)
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

- Space complexity: O(N)
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

# Code
```
class Solution {
    public int longestSubsequence(int[] arr, int k) {
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();

        int max = 0; 
        for(int num : arr){
            map.put(num, map.getOrDefault(num-k, 0) + 1);
            max = Math.max(max, map.get(num));
        }

        return max;
    }
}
